S – Situation:
Hi, I’m [Your Name], and I recently completed a Menternship focused on solving real-world traffic congestion challenges in urban areas.

T – Task:
My goal was to analyze traffic data to identify peak congestion hours and provide actionable insights for better traffic management.

A – Action:
I cleaned and merged complex datasets, engineered meaningful features, and used machine learning models like Random Forest and ARIMA for time-series forecasting. I also performed cross-validation, error analysis, and hyperparameter tuning to refine model performance.

R – Result:
The final output was a comprehensive report with interactive visualizations and data-driven recommendations, demonstrating significant improvement in prediction accuracy and actionable strategies to reduce congestion during peak hours.

This Menternship not only enhanced my technical skills but also gave me real-world experience in turning data into impact.
